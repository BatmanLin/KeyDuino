KeyDuino library is made to be used with [KeyDuino board](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1535978353/keyduino), but it also works by default with a classical Arduino Leonardo using a PN532 Shield, as long as communication is done through HSU.

### Contribution
KeyDuino library is based on Adafruit_NFCShield_I2C, with improvements by Seeed Studio, and HSU(High Speed Uart) driver added by Elechouse.
